          <h3>Analysis</h3>
          <p>The Beyond Design logo is uniquely shaped like a meteorite, with the letter "B" incorporated into its
            design. The white color of the logo enhances its versatility and adaptability, allowing it to seamlessly
            blend with different backgrounds while ensuring optimal visibility and consistent branding. Being in PNG
            format, the logo supports transparency, enabling smooth integration with other design elements for a
            cohesive visual experience.</p>

          <h3>Logo Usage</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">The logo should be used consistently and thoughtfully to maintain a
            strong and cohesive brand identity. Here are some guidelines for using the logo effectively:</p>
          <p>By following these guidelines, you can effectively utilize the SpotHop logo to build brand recognition and
            maintain a consistent visual identity across various platforms and materials.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="Right">
          <h2><span>[1]</span> Clear Space: Ensure that there is sufficient clear space around the logo to maintain its
            visibility and legibility. Avoid crowding it with other elements or text.</h2>
          <h2><span>[2]</span> Size and Scalability: Use the logo in a size that maintains its readability across
            different platforms and materials. It should be easily recognizable even when scaled down or enlarged.</h2>
          <h2><span>[3]</span> Placement: Position the logo prominently in a way that maximizes its visibility and
            impact. Consider placing it at the top left corner of digital assets, such as the website or app interface,
            to reinforce brand recognition.</h2>
          <h2><span>[4]</span> Color Variations: The SpotHop logo can be used in its standard Green, Black or White
            versions for most applications. However, if required, it can also be used in a colour variation that aligns
            with the brand's colour palette, ensuring consistency and recognition.</h2>
          <h2><span>[5]</span> Background Contrast: Choose a background that provides sufficient contrast to the logo,
            ensuring its visibility and legibility. Test the logo on different backgrounds to ensure optimal contrast
            and readability.</h2>
          <h2><span>[6]</span> Proportions: Maintain the original proportions of the logo and avoid distorting or
            stretching it. This helps preserve the integrity of the design and ensures visual harmony.</h2>
